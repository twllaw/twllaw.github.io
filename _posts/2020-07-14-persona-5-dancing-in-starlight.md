As I'm in the middle of Persona 5 Royal right now, I thought it would be a great time to finish off the <a href="https://twllaw.github.io/gaming-thoughts/persona-4-dancing-all-night" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Persona</a> <a href="https://twllaw.github.io/gaming-thoughts/persona-3-dancing-in-moonlight" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dancing</a> trilogy.

I think the remixes and new tracks in this game aren't as strong as P3D and P4D (which is the best of the three in my opinion), but I still had a great time on my way to the Platinum trophy. It's definitely a fan service game and I don't mind that one bit.

The game design is pretty much identical as P3D - you unlock new social interactions, tracks, costumes and accessories, and that's about it. The interactions are fun to watch, but you definitely need to have played Persona 5 first. I also enjoyed the mini game to find cards in people's rooms, as it gave our lovable cast of characters even more depth.

Here are some of my favourites from the soundtrack:

Finally, the end credits track, love this one!

I think I'll pick up the DLC tracks at some point. I just wish the full soundtrack album isn't so <a href="https://www.play-asia.com/persona-dancing-p3d-and-p5d-soundtracks-advanced-collectors-bo/13/70dfad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">damn expensive</a>. Atlus, **PLEASE** release your amazing game soundtracks in the west, and on streaming platforms!
