This was the one PS Vita exclusive that I had wanted to play. I never ended up buying that console, so I was very happy when this was ported to the PS4. Unfortunately the catch is that you have to buy the Persona 3 and 5 Dancing bundle in order to get the DLC code for P4 Dancing, as it wasn't and still isn't being sold separately. So I forked over the money ($158 AUD via Amazon) to Atlus, which I guess isn't too bad considering you're getting three games.

P4 Dancing All Night is pretty much fan service, and as a Persona fan, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I even got the platinum trophy! It wasn't too difficult thankfully. A pre-determined character is assigned to each song, and you can choose between four difficulty levels, then a secondary character, who tags in during portions of the song. The game mechanics are very easy to learn, but can get pretty crazy on the higher difficulties. There's also an option to just watch the performance itself and not having to press any buttons, which is great if you just want to watch Rise or Yukiko do their thing on the dance floor :) All characters have different styles of dance, and they are all very entertaining to watch.

Initially you'll only have access to a handful of songs, but you'll unlock more as you go. There are also tonnes of accessories and costumes to unlock for everyone.

The soundtrack is great. In addition to original P4 and P4D songs, there are also many new remixes of fan favourite tracks:

There is also a story mode, which was surprisingly engaging. It's always great to have the Investigation Team back, and it's an interesting peek inside the craziness that is the Japanese idol industry. In real life there are no demons and alternate worlds though (?)
