Here we have the sequel to Persona Q, this time we follow the P5 cast. The P3 and P4 crews are here as well, but you won't have to choose your starting party like the first game. You'll eventually end up with a huge selection of playable characters, so there's no shortage of the different combinations you can have. This is good but can also be a bit of a headache at times, especially when it comes to re-equipping armour and accessories.

The story is pretty typical Persona affair - something something you shouldn't run away but face your true self, etc. It's mostly fine but the main games have covered these same themes already, so quite often there is a heavy sense of deja vu. Honestly the game isn't really about the story anyway. It's about fan service and seeing your favourite characters interact with each other, and that's totally fine... as long as you ARE a fan of the Persona series.

The gameplay is more or less the same as the first game. I still had a lot of fun going through the dungeons and filling out the maps. You shouldn't have any problems getting through the game, provided you're targeting the enemies' weaknesses, and buffing up when needed. The final boss was very long, but not particularly difficult.

There is a limit on how many items you can carry, and most of the time it's manageable. The storage limit, however, is REALLY annoying, as accessories don't stack up. Towards the end of the game I had to start discarding things because I was at the storage limit. I mean I'm never gonna use 98% of those accessories anyway, but I still wanted them around... it's the JRPGamer's hoarder mentality.

I loved that they were giving out music DLC for free, so that you could hear the classic tunes during combat. As far as new music goes, the hub theme below is my joint!
