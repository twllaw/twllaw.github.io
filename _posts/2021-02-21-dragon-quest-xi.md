Auto battle in this game is great! For the first couple of hours at least.

The first time you return to Cobblestone was a depressing one. Good thing everyone turned out ok!

Prince Faris of Gallopolis, come on man. Good thing Sylvando whipped him into shape!

The locations in DQXI are just gorgeous, Hotto in particular is a stunning town, love the theme too:

Also really loved the music of The Strand / Nautica:

Kai & Michelle's story is genuinely sad.

Obviously with Akira Toriyama as the character designer, there are some Dragon Ball connections. King Carnelian is pretty much Dr. Gero, which is what I called him throughout the game. If you're listening to the Japanese audio, Avarith was voiced by the actor who plays Frieza.

The split party scenarios in Act 2 reminded me of DQIV.

Veronica's fate got me messed up, I honestly thought everyone had survived the tree's destruction. In hindsight it made a lot of sense, that the others only lived because of her sacrifice... *sob*

The amount of palette swapped monsters is a bit disappointing, but understandable given the scope.

Serena the super mage is pretty awesome, too bad that's absent in Act 3.

Puff-Puff bungy was gold. Pretty much every single Puff-Puff moment was gold. Innuendos galore.

Not a fan of the time travel / Dragon Ball shenanigans. It made all the character development in Act 2 a bit pointless, and cheapens the impact of Veronica's death. ðŸ‘Ž

Jade is the best waifu, and damn right I picked her as my partner! Sorry Gemma.

The final trial for Wheel of Harma was ridiculous @_@. Can't believe I managed to complete all the side quests in this game! ðŸŽ‰

Holy shit Calasmos is impossible... Oh, didn't know / realise that you were supposed to use the Sword of Light there. Afterwards it was a cakewalk.

Didn't bother with the last couple of Tockington challenges, because I needed to move on with my life, but I'd say 120+ hours of content is money well-spent. I might even go through the 2D mode one day!
