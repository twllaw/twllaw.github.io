Shin Megami Tensei III came out in Australia around the same time as Shadow Heart Covenant in 2005. I had decided to play the latter and put SMTIII on the back burner. Fast forward more than a decade, I finally started this game in late 2018. Due to its gruelling and unforgiving gameplay, it would take me more than a year to get to the ending. This definitely isn't a game that you pick up and play for relaxation. No, it demands your full attention, or else you'll meet your end at unexpected times. Kids, remember to save often.

The combat is very challenging, but rarely unfair. You can find out about every non-boss monsters' strengths and weaknesses, and it's up to you to use your smarts to get through each battle.

Negotiating with demons can be annoying, but it's worth it once you manage to recruit them, because it means you'll have the option to get out of battles with those same demons later on (unless it's Full Kagutsuchi). They can take my macca or my HP, but they'll never get MP healing items from me... those are rare!

I guess the most infamous battle is Matador, and like most people I made this face: o_O"

I managed to defeat him at level 19! Accuracy buff and counters FTW!

The mini game in Labyrinth of Amala (connecting the Kalpas) reminded me of Sonic with its Sonic-like music. It wasn't fun at all though, wish you could just skip the whole thing.

The dungeon design is one of the best parts of SMTIII in my opinion. Every area has an unique look, and I just love exploring and filling out each map. The Obelisk in particular was pretty epic.

The frequency of random battles is probably the most frustrating part of the game, especially in the final dungeon Tower of Kagutsuchi. After exploring for a few hours in there, it was... ARGH!! I was going to the 'Retreat' option every single time soon after.

Baal avatar... Fly status can't be cured :/ That made things really annoying, though I suppose I could have brought demons who can nullify that effect.

The final boss was easy peasy!! And I got the good(?) ending too :)

Dante's inclusion in this game was a bit forced, but his section in the 3rd Kalpa of Labyrinth of Amala was very memorable and nerve-wracking. The music during the chases definitely got my heart beating fast.

Some of my favourite tracks from the game:

Shoji Meguro you a genius!

Finally, here's the EU/AU cover, and the birth of a meme:
