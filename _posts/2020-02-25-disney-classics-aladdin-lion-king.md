Aladdin on Mega Drive was my favourite game on this system as a kid. I never managed to beat it, however, so I knew that I had to get this compilation when it was first announced.

The platforming is still outstanding, the graphics and sprite animation are still charming, and that lava level still sucks. Shamefully, I did have to cheat and use save states in order to get comfortable and familiar with this damn level. The magic carpet level afterwards sucked as well, but to a lesser extend, because at least you get to move on after three failed attempts. The final boss was pretty annoying too, but the last two levels were a blast to play. I probably only saw them once or twice when I was a kid.

This compilation also came with a bunch of bonus content like artwork and developer interviews. There is also the Aladdin Trade Show demo, and hoo boy (word to Sojiro) that was punishingly difficult to get through, but at least you get a trophy for your troubles.

The Lion King is... yeah, I think I made it about halfway by using save states, don't really want to play any further.
