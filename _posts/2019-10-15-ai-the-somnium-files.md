I absolutely loved the off-beat humour of AI: The Somnium Files. Coupled with memorable characters and an interesting story/mystery, it's the type of game that keeps you coming back for more.

The gameplay is ok, not great. The timie stuff is frustrating because it's not possible to see all the dialogue options unless you play each section more than once. It's a shame because the Aiba / Date interactions during investigations can be so funny, and many players will miss out of them.

The music is great, some of the tunes remind me of Xenoblade. Note to self: get the full soundtrack.

The story is actually quite dark and very disturbing at times. The first time you go to the warehouse somnium, and So Sejima's stabbing memory loop, ugh...

The Atami ending is gold:

Finally, the end credits song and dance is absolutely glorious <3

(SPOILERS!!!)
